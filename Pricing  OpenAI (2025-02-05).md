API Platform

Simple and flexible. Only pay for what you use.

## Latest models

Multiple models, each with different capabilities and price points. Prices can be viewed in units of either per 1M or 1K tokens. You can think of tokens as pieces of words, where 1,000 tokens is about 750 words.

Language models are also available in the [Batch API⁠(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch) that returns completions within 24 hours for a 50% discount.

Embedding models

Build advanced search, clustering, topic modeling, and classification functionality with our embeddings offering.

\*Batch API pricing requires requests to be submitted as a batch. Responses will be returned within 24 hours for a 50% discount. [Learn more about Batch API ↗⁠(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch)

Fine-tuning models

Create your own custom models by fine-tuning our base models with your training data. Once you fine-tune a model, you’ll be billed only for the tokens you use in requests to that model.

Realtime API

The Realtime API lets developers build low-latency, multimodal experiences, including speech-to-speech capabilities. Text and audio processed by the Realtime API are priced separately.

Assistants API

The Assistants API and its tools make it easy for developers to build AI assistants in their applications. The tokens used for the Assistant API are billed at the chosen language model's per-token input / output rates.

Additionally, we charge the following fees for tool usage:

GB refers to binary gigabytes (also known as gibibyte), where 1 GB is 2^30 bytes.

Image models

Build DALL·E directly into your apps to generate and edit novel images and art. DALL·E 3 is the highest quality model and DALL·E 2 is optimized for lower cost.

Audio models

Whisper can transcribe speech into text and translate many languages into English.

Text-to-speech (TTS) can convert text into spoken audio.

Other models

While we continuously improve our latest models, here is a list of other models that we support.
